    <h1>Hi-Lo</h1>
    <h2>A guessing game</h2>
    <p>To play, the dealer will draw the first card from a deck. Your goal is to guess if the next card will be higher or lower than that card.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Guess correctly 3 times in a row and you can choose to swap roles with the dealer or keep guessing.</li>
      <li>If you guess incorrectly, you get a point for each card in the discard pile, then those cards are cleared and your guesses start over at 0.</li>
      <li>Winner is the person with the fewest points when the cards run out.</li>
    </ul>
